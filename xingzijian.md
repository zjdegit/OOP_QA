# machine learning librarys in C++

###1.caffe
Caffe is an open source framework，it can be use in cpu or in gpu.

It is the First Mainstream Industrial Deep Learning Tool,and is the most popular toolkit in the field of computer vision.Many papers have Caffe implementations on the network.
However,it is not flexible enough and has poor support for recursive network and language modeling.It has layer-based network structure, so its scalability is not good.

###2.MXNet
MXNet is committed to provide a deep learning framework that combines performance and flexibility. 
MXNet is supported by Amazon, it is one of the best-performing depth learning frameworks.

###3.Armadillo
Armadillo is a high quality linear algebra library (matrix maths) for the C++ language, aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use .It provides high-level syntax and functionality deliberately similar to Matlab,and is useful for algorithm development directly in C++, or quick conversion of research code into production environments.And various matrix decompositions are provided through integration with LAPACK, or one of its high performance drop-in replacements
###4.many other librarys
1）mlpack :  a C++ machine learning library.

2）PLearn :  a C++ library aimed at research and development in the field of statistical machine learning algorithms. Its originality is to allow to easily express, directly in C++ in a straightforward manner, complex non-linear functions to be optimized.

3）Waffles: C++ Machine Learning。

4）Torch7 provides a Matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient implementation

5）SHARK : a modular C++ library for the design and optimization of adaptive systems. It provides methods for linear and nonlinear optimization, in particular evolutionary and gradient-based algorithms, kernel-based learning algorithms and neural networks, and various other machine learning techniques. SHARK serves as a toolbox to support real world applications as well as research in different domains of computational intelligence and machine learning. The sources are compatible with the following platforms: Windows, Solaris, MacOS X, and Linux.

6）Dlib-ml is an open source library, targetedat both engineers and research scientists, which aims to provide a similarly rich environment fordeveloping machine learning software in the C++ language.

7) Eblearn is an object-oriented C++ library that implements various machine learning models, including energy-based learning, gradient-based learning for machine composed of multiple heterogeneous modules. In particular, the library provides a complete set of tools for building, training, and running convolutional networks.
